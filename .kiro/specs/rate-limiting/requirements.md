# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements rate limiting for the Library Management System API to prevent abuse, protect against DDoS attacks, and ensure fair usage across all users. The system will apply different rate limits for general API endpoints and authentication endpoints, with configurable limits through environment variables.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to implement rate limiting on API endpoints, so that the system is protected from abuse and maintains performance for all users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client makes requests to any API endpoint THEN the system SHALL track the number of requests per IP address
2. WHEN a client exceeds the general rate limit THEN the system SHALL return a 429 status code with appropriate headers
3. WHEN a client is within the rate limit THEN the system SHALL process the request normally
4. WHEN rate limit headers are sent THEN the system SHALL include X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, and X-RateLimit-Reset headers

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want stricter rate limiting on authentication endpoints, so that brute force attacks are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client makes requests to authentication endpoints (/api/auth/*) THEN the system SHALL apply stricter rate limits
2. WHEN a client exceeds the authentication rate limit THEN the system SHALL return a 429 status code with a security-focused error message
3. WHEN authentication rate limits are configured THEN the system SHALL use separate limits from general API endpoints

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable rate limits through environment variables, so that I can adjust limits based on system capacity and requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL read rate limit configuration from environment variables
2. WHEN environment variables are not set THEN the system SHALL use sensible default values
3. WHEN rate limits are configured THEN the system SHALL support separate window periods and request counts for general and auth endpoints
